The Bcfg2 Reporting System
==========================

Bcfg2's reporting system is its killer feature. It allows administrators
to gain a broad understanding of the configuration state of their entire
environment. It summarizes

* Configuration changes and when they were made
* Discrepancies between the specification and current client states

  * Clients can be grouped by misconfiguration type

* Configuration entries that are not specified
* Overall client summaries according to these types

There are two systems, the old system, which builds static reports based
on a series of XSLT stylesheets and a new dynamic reporting system that
uses django and a database backend.
