Configuration Entries
=====================

The full semantics of each configuration entry is documented with the
:ref:`server-plugins-generators-rules` plugin.

.. _boundentries:

Bound Entries
=============

This feature is a mechanism to specify a full entry at once from
a bundle. Traditionally, entries are defined in two stages. First,
an abstract entry is defined in a bundle. This entry includes a type
(the XML tag) and a name attribute. Then this entry is bound for
a client, providing the appropriate instance of that entry for the
client. Specifying a bound entry short-circuits this process; the only
second stage processing on Bound entries is to remove the "Bound" prefix
from the element tag. The use of a bound entry allows the single stage
definition of a complete entry. Bound entries can be used for any type.

Example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Bundle>
       <BoundPackage name='ntp' type='deb' version='1:4.2.4p4+dfsg-3ubuntu2.1'/>
    </Bundle>

altsrc
======

The ``altsrc`` attribute lets you remap configuration entry names on
the server side so you can reuse a single concrete representation for
multiple abstract entries.  See
:ref:`server-plugins-structures-altsrc` for more details.
