The `Ohai`_ plugin is used to detect information about the client
operating system. The data is reported back to the server using JSON.

Client prerequisites
--------------------

On the client, you need to install `Ohai`_. See `Ohai-Install`_ for more
information.

Server prerequisites
--------------------

If you have python 2.6 or later installed, you can continue on to
:ref:`ohai-setup`. Otherwise, you will need to install the
python-simplejson module found packaged in most distributions.

.. _ohai-setup:

Setup
-----

To enable the Ohai plugin, you need to first create an ``Ohai`` directory
in your Bcfg2 repository (e.g. ``/var/lib/bcfg2/Ohai``). You then need
to add **Ohai** to the plugins line in ``bcfg2.conf``. Once this is done,
restart the server and start a client run. You will have the JSON output
from the client in the ``Ohai`` directory you created previously.
