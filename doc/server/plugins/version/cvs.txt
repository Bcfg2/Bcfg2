Why use the CVS plugin
=========================

The CVS plugin is useful if you would like to track changes to
your Bcfg2 repository using a `CVS <http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/>`_
backend. Currently, it enables you to get revision information out
of your repository for reporting purposes. Future plans are to commit
changes to the repo which are made by the server.

How to enable the CVS plugin
===============================

Simply add "Cvs" to your plugins line in ``/etc/bcfg2.conf``::

    [server]
    plugins = Bundler,Cfg,...,Cvs
