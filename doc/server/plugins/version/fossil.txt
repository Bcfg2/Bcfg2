Why use the Fossil plugin
=========================

The Fossil plugin is useful if you would like to track changes to
your bcfg2 repository using a `Fossil SCM <http://fossil-scm.org>`_
backend. Currently, It enables you to get revision information out
of your repository for reporting purposes. Future plans are to commit
changes to the repo which are made by the server.

How to enable the Fossil plugin
===============================

Simply add "Fossil" to your plugins line in ``/etc/bcfg2.conf``::

    [server]
    plugins = Bundler,Cfg,...,Fossil
