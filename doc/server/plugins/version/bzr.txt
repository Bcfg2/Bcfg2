Why use the Bazaar plugin
=========================

The Bazaar plugin is useful if you would like to track changes to
your bcfg2 repository using a `Bazaar <http://bazaar-vcs.org/>`_
backend. Currently, it enables you to get revision information out
of your repository for reporting purposes. Future plans are to commit
changes to the repo which are made by the server.

How to enable the Bazaar plugin
===============================

Simply add "Bzr" to your plugins line in ``/etc/bcfg2.conf``::

    [server]
    plugins = Bundler,Cfg,...,Bzr

Usage notes
===========

Unlike other VCS plugins for Bcfg2, the Bazaar plugin checks whether
there are uncommitted changes to the repository. If there are, this
plugin appends a "+" after the version number. Essentially, this means
you're using that version, "plus" some changes.
