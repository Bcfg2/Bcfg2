This page describes the new Darcs plugin which is experimental.

Why use the Darcs plugin
========================

The Darcs plugin is useful if you would like to track changes to your
Bcfg2 repository using a `Darcs <http://darcs.net/>`_ backend. Currently,
it enables you to get revision information out of your repository for
reporting purposes. Once the plugin is enabled, every time a client
checks in, it will include the current repository revision in the
reports/statistics.

How to enable the Darcs plugin
==============================

You will need to install Darcs on the Bcfg2 server first. Once installed,
simply add Darcs to your plugins line in ``/etc/bcfg2.conf``::

    [server]
    plugins = Bundler,Cfg,...,Darcs
